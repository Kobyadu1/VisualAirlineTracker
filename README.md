# VisualAirlineTracker
 A program written in java with a SQL database back-end that allows the user to view flights for major airports in the US both in a list format and on a map. The user is able to bookmark flights, change between airports and search for flights in the database.
 
Currently does not work due to updates in the websites that I would have to go back and manually fix, however I have provided a video demonstation of the project and the source code from that demo to show my implementation of it.
